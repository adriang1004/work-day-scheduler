#   Work Day Scheduler

##  Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple yet powerful calendar application that enables users to save events for each hour of a typical workday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. This app runs in the browser and uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Day.js is used for date management, making it easier to handle and format date and time.

##  Features
    -   Daily Planner:  View and plan your work schedule by the hour
    -   Pin Events: Click the save button to store it locally
    -   Dynamic Time Coloring:  Time slots are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future, making it easy to see at a glance where you are in your day.
